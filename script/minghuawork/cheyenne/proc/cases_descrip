 1< cesm20ctl cesm20p2k out of the box CESM2.0

 2< beta05ctl beta05p2k CESM2.0beta05 sa above

 3< cesm20mpctl cesm20mpp2k CESM2.0 
    with mg2 paranthesis bug 
    bug leads to grid qr treated as incloud qr, removal of Nr is too small, making 
    Nr remained too large and thus Nc too small, mostens q

 4< cesm20kectl cesm20kep2k
    with zmconv_ke back to smaller value to 1.0e-6 and 3.e-6 as before, dry

storm
 5< F2000Climo 
  CESM1.5_SBU control with SCP
 
 6< F2000MP1 
MG1
CESM1.5_SBU control with SCP and MP1 change to rho in KK2000 autoconversion, accretion

MG1mu same as above added Xin's mu

MG2 same as above, added dispersion options to affect effective radius in rad
 with idl code for offline test of disp episilon
 Liu2 is an option

MG3 same as above, added dispersion impact on collision with the enhanced factor
 with idl code for offline test for beta

MG4 same as above, cleaned the code! for dispersion 4 places instead of 1

COSZ5 same as above, solar zenith angle updated

--->
MP6 ice sedimentation IDL check first

MG7 rain spectrum

!!! MP4 same as above, but use CISRO prediction dtk define a physics tend type variable





 7< AMIP_CTL 
   CASESM1.0 out of the box reference case
